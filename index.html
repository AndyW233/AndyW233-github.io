                    <div class="post-content">
                        <p><em>Party Animals</em> is a casual 3D multiplayer fighting game.
                            Just like other fighting games, the goal of this game is to knock
                            down other players. But in this game, the player will fight as cute
                            creatures like puppies. This game does not have huge background stories or
                            needs to practice a lot to gain more experiences. Which perfectly matches
                            casual game design values: simplicity, acceptability, accessibility and
                            flexibility. (Kultima, 2009)

                    <div class="post-content">
                        <p>A good game can be delivered in many forms.
                            It can be like a novel to tell a good story like <em>Assassin's Creed</em>
                            or need a lot of practices like <em>League of Legends</em>. A good casual game
                            needs to simplify the design to make the game easier to play.</p>
                        <h4><strong>2.1 Unique Controls</strong></h4>
                        <p>
                            How you control the characters is very unique. Characters all have a soft feeling.
                            Actions are basic attacking, kicking, head bumping, rolling, climbing,
                            throwing and running, but in a very cute way. The stamina bar will
                            consume when the player uses the actions beside basic attacking. As a
                            fighting game, actions are simplified to a point that player just need
                            to know how to move and how to use the basic attack. This enables the
                            playability for all kinds of gamers.

                        <h4>2.2 Weapons</h4>
                        <p>
                        Many weapons will generate randomly during the game. Different weapons have different attributes, but all a player just needs to know is how to grab the weapon and attack by using the basic attack button. How each weapon functions are simplified so that after a player uses it once, the functionality is obvious.

                        <h4><strong>3.1 Game Modes</strong></h4>
                        <p>
                            Two modes are implemented for this game so far, last stand and snatch squad.
                        </p>
                        <p>3.1.1 last stand<br>Not like other games, players do not have an HP. A loss is determined depending on the map. Staying in the poison gas too long, falling down the plane, or falling down the submarine. The player stands to the last wins. The player that wins three rounds will become the final winner.</p>

                        <p>3.1.2 Snatch Squad<br>Player will join two teams, the goal of each game is to collect candies that will refresh in the middle of the map, the team that collect the most candies wins.</p>

                        <p>Most popular games' categories right now are FPS, MOBA and RPG, but many of these games contain offensive topics. Two game modes of <em>Party Animals</em> are fighting but delivered adorably. Which makes it more acceptable for people.</p>

                        <p>
                            A game will usually contain a tutorial and the tutorial need to expect that some players have the lack of common game literacy. The tutorial for party animals explains all the actions you can do which make the game "possible for people with varying limitations." (Kultima, 2009)

                        <p><em>Party Animals</em> will be a multi-platform title, which enables its physical accessibility. The physical accessibility is also important to a casual game. If a player can play it together by using different devices. Currently, they just finished beta testing on PC, if they can release the game in multiple platforms, physical accessibility will reach a very high level.</p>

                        <p>This game is designed with the flexibility to support different players. You can start the game at any place and time you want. The game is also not very intense and error-forgiving. (Kultima, 2009) You do not have to pay full attention and if you make any mistake, no punishment like rank dropping will happen. It is a game for you when you have time to spend, a family game, and a party game.</p>

                    <div class="post-content">
                        <p>A lot of things can be improved. Logics of using keyboards are adapted to controllers.
                            Although it is easier for game making, the logic can be different for different kinds of players.
                            For example, on controllers, the right stick is for changing the viewing angle. But on keyboards,
                            we need to use the keys 'Q' and 'E' instead of the mouse. Some hints can be delivered in the game.
                            For example, in the submarine map, nothing will be said when missile launches. But it has the
                            effect of pushing player down the submarine. If a player is playing it for the first time,
                            they might disappoint by that.
                        </p>
                        <p>More features can be added. For local games, it can support more than one player at once to make it more like a party game. More characters can be added and the player can have the ability to change the outfit of their characters.</p>

                    <div class="post-content">
                        <p>As people’s time is becoming fragmented. Many people do not have time to sit back and play a hardcore game for 24 hours. Which makes casual games more and more popular. The other side of hardcore gamers is casual gamers. Casual gamers are usually just playing games to be social and have fun. They are not very competitive. Relatively speaking, a casual game for them is easier to produce, but the design is much harder to do. It needs to be simple enough but also needs to have enough content so that players do not get bored after several games. The same problem comes to <em>Party Animals</em> or other games like <em>Fall Guys</em>, too. The ways these games have been played are quite limited. </p>
                        <p>The future of casual game may go through two stages. The first stage is after some time there will be a new popular casual game. The second stage will be the time that a solution comes up for a casual game to be simple and not limited content at the same time.</p>
                        <p>For now, a new popular casual game pops up after some time is fine. This means the casual game industry will become more and more competitive, which can make the whole industry becomes better. </p>

                    <div class="post-content">
                        <p>Nowadays, it seems like we need to make everything "meaningful". Especially for the game industry, it is transforming from "not understandable" to the mainstream. More and more people start to study it and try to give them more meanings. The standard of a good game is examined by more and more aspects like how good the storytelling is, the level of graphics, what values it can bring to people and so on. To me, games do not need to prove anything for anyone. They just need to bring me joy and fun. Fun is the main idea of games and emphasized by casual games. As simple as a game like <em>Party Animals</em>, it does not need to have a wonderful background story or huge philosophy idea behind it, they just need to be fun. To sum up, <em>Party Animals</em> have casual game design values, simplicity, acceptability, accessibility and flexibility. It also delivers that a good game just needs to be simple and fun.</p>
